## Power sensing shield for ST Discovery STM32F407VG-based board##


## How to use ##
The boards have been designed using the free Kicad design software, ehich is available at http://www.kicad-pcb.org/display/KICAD/KiCad+EDA+Software+Suite.

Once Kicad is installed, you can open these designs by opening the .pro file in the root directory of the repository.
You will need to add the folder 'kicad' to your library path in the schematic editor and the folder 'kicad/footprints' to your library path in the PCB tool.
